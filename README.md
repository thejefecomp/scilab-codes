This repository has been created to support teaching activities of a course named Computer Programming for Engineers II (Programação para Engenharia II in portuguese). The aforementioned course has been given by myself at State University of Santa Catarina (UDESC), Joinville-SC, Brazil. Currently, the course material is managed by NeartWord, my personal company linked to the NeartWord project (https://www.neartword.com).
